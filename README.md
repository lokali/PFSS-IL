## Overview

- The permutation flow shop scheduling (PFSS), aiming at finding the optimal permutation of jobs, is widely used in manufacturing systems.

- In our paper, we train the model via expert-driven **imitation learning** to accelerate the convergence. Our learning model is based on the **graph structure**, which incorporates the GGCN (Gated Graph ConvNets) as the encoder.

## Implementations

For our imitation learning model, our code is developing based on [here](https://github.com/chaitjo/learning-tsp).  

- Installation:

```sh
# Environment: Ubuntu 16.04, using Python 3.6.7, PyTorch 1.2.0 and CUDA 10.0. Anaconda
# Clone the repository. 
git clone https://github.com/SCLBD/IL_PFSS.git 

# Set up a new conda environment and activate it.
conda create -n tsp python=3.6.7
source activate tsp

# Install all dependencies and Jupyter Lab (for using notebooks).
conda install pytorch=1.2.0 cudatoolkit=10.0 -c pytorch  
conda install numpy scipy cython tqdm scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn tensorboard pandas
conda install jupyterlab -c conda-forge
pip install tensorboard_logger
```



- Quick start for our imitation learning model 
```sh
cd learning-pfss

# Quick Training
./scripts/train.sh 
    
# Quick Testing.   
./scripts/test.sh
```

For the other four heuristic baselines (random search, iterated local search, iterated greedy, NEH), our code is developing based on [here](https://github.com/omega-coder/flowshop_scheduling_problem).

```sh
cd baselines
python run_heuristics.py 
```
